I know this is a little out of the blue, but I saw you on Tinder and your profile picture really intrigued me, as I think you're really attractive, and it's for that reason that I'd like to get to know you better, if that's something you're keen on as well.

I'm aware that there's the possibility that you may be taken, not looking, or are just not comfortable with talking to a stranger who approached you through Facebook, so I entirely understand if you don't reply. If this is the case, I thank you for taking the time to read this, and I sincerely hope that you can take my approach as a compliment. But if you'd be interested in talking, I would love the opportunity to hear from you.
